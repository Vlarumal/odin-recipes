<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    These vegan brownies are made with cocoa powder for a rich and gooey chocolaty treat. 
    If you prefer brownies that are a little more solid, you can bake the brownies for longer 
    than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!

<h2>Vegan Brownie Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade vegan brownie recipe:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flour: This vegan brownie starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li>Sugar: Make sure the package is labeled “vegan,” 
        as some store-bought white sugars aren’t strictly vegan.</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder: You’ll need ¾ cups of good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder.</li> 
    <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, 
        which means it helps the vegan brownies rise.</li>
    <li>Salt: Salt enhances the overall flavor of the brownies, 
        but it won’t make them taste salty.</li>
    <li>Water or coffee: Use a cup of hot water (or a cup of brewed coffee for more flavor).</li>
    <li>Oil: Vegetable oil keeps these vegan brownies nice and moist.</li>
    <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>

</ul>
